In this code, you will learn to create the iphone calculator with the built-in java awt/swing graphics library.

Throughout the code, you will learn how to create a gui (graphical user interface) for the calculator, style the buttons to resemble the iphone calculator, add numbers to a display, and evaluate different mathematical expressions through button clicks.

You can continue working on this project if you like. You can implement the missing click handler for the squareroot button. In addition you can expand the number of buttons to include scientific calculations with sin, cos, tan, log, etc. You can also add a delete button to remove a digit at a time as opposed to clear all, and other functions such as absolute value, power, remainder, etc.
